        <h1>Personal Statement and CV</h1>

        <p>I am honored to have been nominated for the Outstanding TA Award for 2022. I feel that I am a good
            candidate for this award because I have consistently gotten feedback from my students on how they felt
            I was a good teacher and that I helped them learn the material and pass the courses I have taught. I
            greatly enjoy teaching and plan to go on to be a professor after graduation so this feedback has been quite
            encouraging. Thank you for considering me for this award. - Gwen Hartshaw</p>

        <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

        <p>As an instructor I strive to encourage students to reach their full potential to understand and use the
            material I teach in my classes. Often students come into my classes with the preconception that physics (and
            math) are hard and that they are "bad at it" - my goal is for them to believe that they <em>can</em>
            understand and use physics by the end of the course. One way in which I try to encourage this mindset
            is to give what is called wise critism - that is when talking to students about their work I try to
            emphasise what they are doing correctly rather then focusing on what they have gotten wrong.</p>

        <p>I try to structure my classes such that for the majority of the class period the students are working
            on problems in small groups. Math and physics are learned by <em>doing problems</em>, not just listening
            to or watching someone else talk about the concepts. By having the students work in groups
            those students who are doing well get experience explaining the concepts (which helps strengthen their
            understanding) and those that are struggling can have the material explained to them by someone who
            has a similar background (leading to a more comprehensable explanation). Then, if any group still gets
            stuck on a problem I am present to lead the students along the process toward the right answer.</p>

        <p>It is important while constructing and working with these groups to make sure that the groups work well
            together and do not lead to a single student doing all the work and then just telling the other group
            members the answers. Another issue which could arise is for a student to be excluded by a group (due to a
            language barrier or any other factors). Careful construction of groups (based on responses to a short
            survey and math assessment given on the first day of class) and a grading scheme made to give points
            for good group work reduce the chances of these problems occuring.</p>

        <h1>Teaching Responsibilities</h1>

        <p>I have held a number of teaching positions at Syracuse University for both the Physics and Mathematics
            departments. Over the past 4 years I have taught or was a TA for the following classes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>MAT 295 - Calculus I<br />Fall 2018, Fall 2019<br /><em>Recitation TA</em>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>MAT 284 - Buisness Calculus<br />Spring 2019<br /><em>Recitation TA</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>MAT 285 - Life Sciences Calculus I<br />Spring 2020<br /><em>Teaching Instructor</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>PHY 212 - General Physics II<br />Spring 2020, Fall 2021, Spring 2021, Fall
                    2022<br /><em>Recitation TA</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>PHY 101 - Major Concepts of Physics I<br />Summer 2021<br /><em>Primary Instructor</em></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The courses where my role was Recitation TA (MAT 295, MAT 284, and PHY 212) were all large lecture
            courses.
            For these courses I was responsible for 2-5 recitation sections. For the bulk of these recitations I
            would
            have students work on problems in small groups and I would go around an help them when they got stuck;
            these
            worksheets were jointly written by all of the TA's for the course. The two math courses also had short
            weekly quizzes given at the start of recitations - also jointly written by me and the other TA's and
            graded
            by me. Finally I was responsible for helping proctor and grade exams for the courses.
        </p>

        <p>For MAT 285 I have put my role as Teaching Instructor as I was the instructor for one section working
            under a
            head instructor. The head instructor prepared the syllabus, selected the textbook, determined the course
            schedule, and set the homework and I was responsible for all other duties. These included preparing and
            giving lectures as well as writing and grading tests and quizzes.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, I was the Primary Instructor for the summer section of PHY 101 and was fully responsible for all
            parts of the course. I wrote the syllabus, selected the textbook, gave lectures, assigned and graded
            homework, and wrote and graded "quizzams" (an assessment somewhere between a quiz and an exam). This
            course
            also has a lab component and I worked with a TA who prepared and administered these labs.
